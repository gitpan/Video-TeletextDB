Revision history for Perl extension Video::TeletextDB.

- Todo:
    - Much more tests are needed
    - Higher teletext levels
    - Maybe add documentation and tests for want (maybe needs to be renamed?)

	- Small doc updates
	- Put the DB_RO and DB_RW classes under Video::TeletextDB
	- Fix author email address
	- Use the V4L2 interfaces to get the frequency in TeleCollect
	- Run the tests in a temp dir
	- Let TeleCollect also report channel changes on the first frequency 
	  measurement in the loop.
	- Add $VERSION in TeleCollect
	- Solaris unlink dir gives EPERM, not EISDIR (and actually succeeds
          for root (which is not fixed yet))
